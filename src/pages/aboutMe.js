        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Kathryn Rieb, and I am currently studying software engineering at the University of Victoria. I enjoy learning and maintaining a variety of skills, and my current projects range from making android apps using SQL databases to creating VR-compatible games in Unity.

Outside of programming, my other interests include volunteering in the community, playing the violin, baking, and painting.</p>
